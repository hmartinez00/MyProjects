2 Reyes 6:24-33
THE DIRE STRAITS OF THOSE WHO FORSAKE GOD
This siege was the result of Ahab’s foolish and misplaced leniency. See 1Ki_20:42. The children are often called to suffer for the misdeeds and follies of their parents. Let us bear this in mind. “No man liveth to himself.” Conduct yourself so that none may be offended through long years after you have passed from earth.
Apparently Elisha had counseled the king not to surrender, with the further assurance of deliverance on condition of his repentance. Jehoram therefore assumed the signs of penitence and contrition without the reality; and when the promised deliverance was not forthcoming, he put the blame of Israel’s calamities on the prophet, and vowed vengeance against his life. The elders were gathered with Elisha, perhaps for prayer, when Elisha apprised them of the advent of the king’s messenger, with his announcement of the royal determination not to wait for God any longer. The trial of our patience is more precious than of gold, but how few of us can endure it!
